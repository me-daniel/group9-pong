# group9-pong

This is our final project for the course "Basic Programming in Python" 2021 at the university of Osnabr√ºck. We implemented the oldschool Atari game "pong" with a few changes.


## Startup instructions:
 - Go to your command line and make sure you have python installed.
 - Install the pygame library using the command `pip install pygame`.
 - Move to the BasicPong folder inside your command line and start pong.py using the command `python pong.py`.
 - Press *1* for Singleplayer and *2* for Multiplayer mode. Use *w* and *s* or *UP* and *DOWN* keys for the movement.

 The game should run now! It was primarily made for Windows and even though it is playable on every system, the font is not optimized for Mac OS.
